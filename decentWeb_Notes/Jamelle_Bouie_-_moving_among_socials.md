# 2022-12-16 Jamelle Bouie - on moving among the socials

b-boy bouiebaisse (@jbouie): So I joined Post but I'm on the waitlist, if you use this to sign up then supposedly I will be off the waitlist sooner. https://post.news/?r=UCPL5

I have a Mastodon handle but honestly I don't think the site is all that good or usable. If you want to find me elsewhere, your best bets are Instagram (where I'm also @jbouie), TikTok (where I'm "jamellebouie") and my blog. http://jamellebouie.net

I also might create a subreddit? Who knows, I don't have the time to moderate that shit.

anyway the problem with trying to find a twitter alternative -- and part of the reason i like tiktok quite a bit -- is that what this places does well is discovery. there are a lot of people i follow here who i would have never found if i were in my own little silo.
