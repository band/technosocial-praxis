# 2025-03-25 test note

this is a note to test putting a `git pull` facility into `markpub_bskypost`

test 1 was a bust; maybe test 2?

test 2 overdid it and pulled (downloaded) the entire repo not just the changed files.
maybe test 3 is the charm?

test 3 is not the charm.  

this is getting out of hand; maybe best to just do a system command?

## 2025-03-28  
- `markpub_bskypost` moved to pypi.org  

## 2025-03-30  
- testing continues: this time to try to include `git pull` after the updated Markdown file is pushed to the remote repo.
- it works!
- DONE: test running `markup_bskypost` from a directory outside the repo dir
- TODO: untangle the arg parsing and config file parameters use

## 2025-03-31
- testing continues as we allow `markpub_bskypost` to run in a directory outside of the website repository clone  
- also allow command-line arguments to overwrite what is specified in the `bskypost.yaml` file
- seems to work well enough for prime time

## 2025-04-01
- overthinking the code; one more test?, then move version to 1.0.0
