# 2025-03-25 test note

this is a note to test putting a `git pull` facility into `markpub_bskypost`

test 1 was a bust; maybe test 2?

test 2 overdid it and pulled (downloaded) the entire repo not just the changed files.
maybe test 3 is the charm?

test 3 is not the charm.  

this is getting out of hand; maybe best to just do a system command?

## 2025-03-28  
- `markpub_bskypost` moved to pypi.org
