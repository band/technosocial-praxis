<p>2024-12-17: [## <a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky/#f">How decentralized is Bluesky really?</a>]<br />
By Christine Lemmer-Webber on Fri 22 November 2024<br />
- some key notions:<br />
- <strong>Decentralization</strong> is the result of a system that diffuses power throughout its structure, so that no node holds particular power at the center.<br />
- "<strong>Federation</strong>", as has been used as a <em>technical</em> term since the emergence of the "Fediverse" ... is a technical approach to communication architecture which achieves decentralization by many independent nodes cooperating and communicating to be a unified whole, with no node holding more power than the responsibility or communication of its parts.<br />
- Reference definitions of these terms (from wordnik) that I think are close enough to how Christine uses these terms in this post:<br />
- <strong>decentralized</strong>: (adjective) not centralized; having no center or several centers: from <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/decentralized">Wiktionary, Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License</a><br />
- <strong>federation</strong>: (noun) the act of constituting a political unity out of a number of separate states or colonies or provinces so that each member retains the management of its internal affairs: from <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/federation">WordNet 3.0 Copyright 2006 by Princeton University</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one other thing which Bluesky gets right, and which the present-day fediverse does not. This is that Bluesky uses content-addressed content, so that content can survive if a node goes down.<br />
... even though such a thing is spec-compatible with ActivityPub, <em>content-addressing is not done today on ActivityPub</em>, and <em>is</em> done on Bluesky.<br />
SIDENOTE: "content-addressed content": i do not understand what this means; i need an example and counter-example<br />
...
Bluesky's direct messages ... don't use any particular kind of protocol which is amenable to decentralization or federation.<br />
SIDENOTE: what property or properties of protocol make them "amenable to decentralization or federation"?<br />
...<br />
... in all ways related to the distribution of power, Bluesky's technology is notably much less distributed than existing and prominent decentralized technology <em>in deployment today</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, this should actually be the way Bluesky brands itself ... : an open architecture (that is fair to say!) with the possibility of credible exit. This would be more accurate and reflect better what is provided to users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...
(edited from the Decentralized Identifiers history section) " ... the web (is) open and decentralized. Also, the naming+encryption system the web runs on top of is not: DNS+TLS relies on trusting ICANN on down and TLS Certificate Authorities, both of which are centralized approaches."<br />
N.B.: <code>did:web</code> provides the same security as retrieving a key over <code>https:</code></p>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... one thing I think <em>is</em> true: the fediverse <em>is</em> decentralized and <em>is</em> federated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I stand by my assertions that Bluesky is not meaningfully decentralized and that it is certainly not federated according to any technical definition of federation we have had in a decentralized social network context previously. To claim that Bluesky is decentralized or federated in its current form moves the goalposts of both of those terms ....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... "credible exit" really is the right term for Bluesky's architectural goals. Rearchitecting towards meaningful decentralization and federation is a massive overhaul of Bluesky's infrastructure, but providing "credible exit" is not. It is my opinion that leaning into "credible exit" is the best thing that Bluesky can do: perhaps a large corporation or two always have to sit at the center of Bluesky, but perhaps also it will be possible for people to leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Some acronyms and other terms for which I needed definitions:</p>
<p>PBC: Public Benefit Corporation</p>
<p>PDS:</p>
<p>Relay:</p>
<p>"content-addressed content": TODO: include a useful definition and example</p>
<p><em>credible exit</em>: if Bluesky Social PBC goes out of business or loses usersâ€™ trust, other providers can step in to provide an equivalent service using the same dataset and the same protocols. -- <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03239">Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media</a></p>
