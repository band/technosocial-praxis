# 2024-05-14 federated socials

I view Bluesky, Threads, X(FKAT), nostr, all the Mastodon instances, and spin-offs from them, as well as Insta, TikTok, and even Facebook, and others, as comprising a decentralized system of social networks (the "socials"). These systems are like silos, in that I end up having accounts on each if I want to participate. Having a bridge, or bridges, among these silos, is one way to enable participation of, say, me from my Mastodon instance, to participate in Bluesky, and vice-versa. There are social issues with bridges; different socials have different rules and norms of participation, control of information, visibility of posts, and so on. Communication among the silos is key to having a larger, connected, social federation. That's how I think about it now.
