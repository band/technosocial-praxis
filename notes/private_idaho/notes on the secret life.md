# notes on the secret life

This page is inspired by Gabriel García Márquez, the Colombian author of *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, and the preeminent example of magic realism;-- and his [quote](http://instagram.com/p/m54I22ED1Y/), “Everyone has three lives: a public life, a private life, and a secret life."

What, you expected to find secrets here?
