# 2025-11-17 federated web experiences

In the past week I have observed some of the consequences of moving my Bluesky account from `bsky.social` to `blacksky.community`. The primary purpose of this move is to experience and explore _atproto_ federation. My rationale: if I am going to be in a decentralized and federated collection of social networks ("socials"), then I am curious about what that entails. So,The results have been informative. Support from `blacksky.community` when I mis-read the documentation was fast and direct.  

One regret I have in moving my account off `bsky.social` is that the ATproto APIs are not yet available on the `blacksky.community` _atproto_ systems. Support for these APIs is planned (and such plans are documented here: \[TODO: link here\]. Without these APIs there is no easy way to provide "Bluesky Comments" capability for posts on Blacksky PDSs. Also, the \[bridgy-fed\] service that linked the Bluesky social with Mastodon instances and vice-versa, is not available.<*sigh*/>
